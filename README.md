# 👋 Hi, I’m Dhruvil Mamtora

Just a curious human trying to learn how to code from scratch 


## 🚀 About Me


1. 🤹‍♂️ I start 10 projects and finish none (but I’m trying)  
2. 🧠 Learning to code from scratch because chaos is fun  
3. 💾 My code runs after 27 errors and 3 breakdowns  
4. 🚀 Goal: make something that works on the first try (lol)
